# Holiday travel project
Created by [Noah Rogers](http://noaharogers.github.io).

Holiday is a static travel website that specializes in bundled packages as well as hotel, flights and rental car reservations. This project is a way for me to demonstrate what I've learned during my [8th Light](http://www.8thlight.com) Apprenticeship over the last several months.
